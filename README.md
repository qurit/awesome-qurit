# Qurit-Awsome
Below is a list of tools we at Qurit find useful when we are developing new radiomolecular imaging and therapy techniques.

## Contents
- [Imaging Software](#imaging-software)

## Imaging Software
- [idoimaging.com](https://idoimaging.com/) is an amazing place to find free/open source medical imaging software/tools 
- [NMMItools](https://nmmitools.org/) is a handy reference website for software tools to simulate, reconstruct and analyze synthetic or real data related to Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (NMMI) studies.
- [Mango](http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/) is a viewer for medical research images. It provides analysis tools and a user interface to navigate image volumes. 
- [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki) is an open source software package for the analysis and visualization of neuroimaging data. 

## Datasets
- [Image Datasets](https://sites.google.com/site/aacruzr/image-datasets) is another extensive list of image datasets 
- [Medical Imaging datasets](https://github.com/sfikas/medical-imaging-datasets) is yet another extensive list of medical imaging datasets 
- [Medical Data for Machine Learning](https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data) is a curated list of medical data for machine learning. 
- [Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/browse.php?cat=6) is another online repository for datasets 
- [PPMI Dataset](https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data/) provides access to all clinical, imaging and biomarker data collected in PPMI (Including both raw and processed MRI and SPECT images)
- [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) performs a search of similar paper and arranges them in a graph based on similarities. 
- Extensive list of pretrained computer vision models. [Link](https://github.com/balavenkatesh3322/CV-pretrained-model) 
- Extensive list of open access medical image repositories/datasets. [Link](http://www.aylward.org/notes/open-access-medical-image-repositories)
